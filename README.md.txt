Digits Dataset  

This project involves the use of a Convolutional Neural Network to implement image recognition on the digits dataset.  

The input given is a hand-written image of a number.  

The model created has the task of recognizing the number and give that number as the output.  

This project was created by Vihaan Tewari (UID : BWr6pV7PE) as part of the industrial internship project for Foxmula.
